Adventure in Unlambda
=====================

This is a translation into [Unlambda][] esoteric programming language
of Don Knuth's [CWEB version][] of [Adventure][] (aka Colossal Cave
Adventure). The original Adventure was written by Willie Crowther and
Don Woods.

How to Play
-----------

You need an interpreter of Unlambda version 2. I recommend the
c-refcnt interpreter included in the [Unlambda 2.0.0 distribution][Unlambda],
or [the first one][Emil] written by Emil Jerabek.

Or, you can play it on your web browser at inazz's
[JavaScript Unlambda interperter][unlambda_js]!

How to Develop
--------------

The Unlambda code is generated by the Scheme code in src/
directory. You need [Gauche][] Scheme interpreter to run it.
