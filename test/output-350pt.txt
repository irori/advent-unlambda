There are some keys on the ground here.
There is a shiny brass lamp nearby.

here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
says "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".

You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.

At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
Rough stone steps lead down the pit.
* 
You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
Rough stone steps lead up the dome.
* 
This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
"You won't get it up the steps".
There is a large sparkling nugget of gold here!
* OK.
* 
You're in Hall of Mists.
* 
You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.

chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
round two-foot hole slants down.

drives the snake away.

* A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
axe at you, cursed, and ran away.  (The axe missed.)

very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able

go west, east, NE, and NW.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
bedrock block.

the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
A small velvet pillow lies on the floor.

* 
You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.

and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
* 
You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
the wall above the pit at this end of the room.

You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  There once were large passages

* 
You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves, who as you know are extremely vain.)
A small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
* 
You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.

west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
profusion of leaves.

the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].

passage leading back to the north.
* 
You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.
* 
You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
directions.
* 
You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A SW path leads away
from the chasm into a winding corridor.
A rickety wooden bridge extends across the chasm, vanishing into the
mist.  A sign posted on the bridge reads, "STOP!  PAY TROLL!"
A burly troll stands by the bridge and insists you throw him a
treasure before you may cross.
* The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
* 
You're in sloping corridor.
* 
You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, SE, and SW.

chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
the gloom.

This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
passage leads SE, and a hands-and-knees crawl leads west.
* 
You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
exits to the south and west.
* 
You are in an alcove.  A small NW path seems to widen after a short
distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.

You're at "Y2".

You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.
A shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.

* The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
smoke). . . .    Then your eyes refocus; you look around and find...

You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads:  "DO
NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
* If you were to quit now, you would score 311
out of a possible 350.
Do you indeed wish to quit now?
** OK.
* 
You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.
A large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.
A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a
large steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "TREASURE
VAULT.  KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."
The grate is locked.
* OK.
* 
You're at NE end.
* OK.
* 
You're at SW end.
The grate is locked.
* There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
You scored 350 points out of a possible 350, using 356 turns.
All of Adventuredom gives tribute to you, Adventure Grandmaster!
To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!
Congratulations!!
